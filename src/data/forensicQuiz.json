    "question": "What is the FIRST step in any digital forensic investigation?",
    "options": [
      "A) Analyze the evidence",
      "B) Create a forensic image of the storage media",
      "C) Search for malware",
      "D) Interview the suspect"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Creating a forensic image ensures evidence preservation and maintains chain of custody. Analysis should NEVER be performed on original evidence to prevent modification."

      "C) SHA-256",
      "D) CRC32"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "SHA-256 is the current standard. MD5 and SHA-1 have known collision vulnerabilities making them unreliable for legal evidence. NIST recommends SHA-256 or higher."

      "D) Encrypt the evidence"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Write blockers prevent ANY modification to original evidence, ensuring forensic soundness. Even mounting a drive without write protection can alter timestamps and metadata."

      "A) Deleted file names",
      "B) Unused space between file end and cluster boundary",
      "C) Encrypted data",
      "D) File metadata"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Slack space is the unused portion of the last cluster allocated to a file. It may contain remnants of previously deleted files, making it valuable for data recovery and artifact discovery."

    "question": "Which forensic principle states that every contact leaves a trace?",
    "options": [
      "A) Chain of custody",
      "B) Locard's Exchange Principle",
      "C) Daubert Standard",
      "D) Best Evidence Rule"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Locard's Exchange Principle: 'Every contact leaves a trace.' In digital forensics, this means every interaction with a system leaves artifacts (logs, files, registry changes, network traffic)."

    "id": 9,
    "question": "What is the difference between logical and physical acquisition of mobile devices?",
    "options": [
      "A) Logical is faster, physical is slower",
      "B) Logical gets active files, physical gets raw storage including deleted data",
      "C) Logical requires root, physical doesn't",
      "D) They are the same"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Logical acquisition extracts active file system data (like a backup). Physical acquisition creates bit-for-bit copy of storage chip, including unallocated space with deleted files and fragments."

      "C) User passwords",
      "D) File transfers"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "TCP sequence number anomalies indicate packet injection, session hijacking, or MITM attacks. Normal sequences increment predictably; gaps or duplicates suggest tampering."
